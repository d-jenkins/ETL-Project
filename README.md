# ETL-Project

## Background
For this project, we were tasked with finding an interesting data source and performing the ETL process on it. In the below sections, you will read how we Extracted our data, made necessary transformations to it and loaded it into a database. 

## Extract
First, we explored kaggle.com to find an interesting data source to work with. We found our winner in a data source that provided 3 CSV files with the ranks of the top restuarants from 2020. We found this data interesting because not only do we love going out to eat, but also because of the specfics about the way each file was created.

Overview of each CSV file:
* Future 50:
    * Provided the rankings of the future 50 top restaurants. This provides a list of what are deemed the fastest growing restaurant with sales between $20 and $50 million. Rankings are based on the percent change in systemwide sales from 2018 to 2019.
* Independence 100:
    * Provided the rankings of the top 100 Independent Restaurants from 2020. An independent restaurant is defined as one that has no more than five locations. Rankings are based on gross 2019 food and beverage sales.
* Top 250:
    * Provided rankings of the top 250 restaurants from 2020. This provides a list of the top 250 chain restaurants based on company financial filings, direct operator surveying, franchise disclosure documents, and proprietary valuation algorithms.

* All data was pulled from Restaurant Business Online

After downloaded our data. We loaded it into our Jupyter Notebook in order to make the CSV's easy to work with for our planned transformations.
