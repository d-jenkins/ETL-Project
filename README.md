# ETL-Project

## Background
For this project, we were tasked with finding an interesting data source and performing the ETL process on it. In the below sections, you will read how we Extracted our data, made necessary transformations to it and loaded it into a database. 

## **E**xtract
First, we explored kaggle.com to find an interesting data source to work with. We found our winner in a data source that provided 3 CSV files with the ranks of the top restuarants from 2020. 

After downloaded our data. We loaded it into our Jupyter Notebook in order to make the CSV's easy to work with for our planned transformations.

The data described above can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/restaurant-business-rankings-2020.
